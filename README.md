This is a set of SCSS mixins we use widely in our projects.

## Library contents

Mixins:

- **button-style-reset** — local reset of a button tag styles;
- **placeholder** — vendor-prefixed pseudo-elements for a placeholder of a text field;
- **text-cut** — single-line text cut with ellipsis;
- **multiline-text-cut** — multi-line text cut with ellipsis;
- **visually-hidden** — hide an element visually, still allowing assistive technologies to access it.
